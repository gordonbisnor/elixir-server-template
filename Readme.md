# Rails Server Template

## Overview

This is a template chef structure for deploying Rails applications. It's
primarily aimed at projects that want everything running on a single VPS
but don't want to use a SaaS platform such as Heroku.

## Documentation

Currently working on a detailed tutorial for using chef to provision
rails app servers, I tend to prioritise based on feedback I get on
demand so if it's something you'd like to see, let me know by email 
ben@talkingquickly.co.uk or twitter @talkingquickly

The first draft of the tutorial is available at;

http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/2013/09/using-chef-to-provision-a-rails-and-postgres-server/

Until I get around to a new Readme.
